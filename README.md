# Pokemon Arbitrary Code Execution Programs

/!\ The programs in this repository are written for Pok√©mon Red (US) **only** at the moment and are **not** guaranteed to be stable or complete. Use at your own risk! /!\
Code dump for handy/larger ACE programs I worked on. Some programs may be optimized for use with ACE items like `8F` but it is not the main focus. It is recommended to have a memory editor (in-game or via an emulator) to write and execute code from this repository.
